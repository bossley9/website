<p>The information and materials provided through the Site, including any data, text, photographs, graphics, images, music, audio and video clips, logos, icons, software and links (collectively, the "Materials") are intended to educate and inform you. At least, most of the time. The Site is owned and operated by Sam Co. in conjunction with others pursuant to contractual arrangements, and the Materials (and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto) are and will remain the property of Sam Co. and its licensors and suppliers. The Materials and the selection, compilation, collection, arrangement and assembly thereof are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark and other laws, and you acknowledge that these rights are valid and enforceable. The Materials may be used solely to the extent necessary for your authorized use of the Site, as provided in these Terms of Use or as expressly authorized in writing by Sam Co. or, if so indicated in writing by Sam Co., its licensors or suppliers. Modification of the Materials or use of the Materials for any other purpose is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. We may change the Site or delete Materials or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Materials.</p>
<p>Although Sam Co. strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, laws, regulations, data and other information change frequently and are subject to varying interpretations. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Sam Co. endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. Further, the Materials should not be construed as professional advice on any subject matter, and availability or use of the Materials is not intended to create, and does not create, any professional services love relationships.</p>
<p>Please note that portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various individuals(AKA Sam). The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement of the views expressed therein. Information provided by individuals, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person providing such information.

<b><p>IX. CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</p></b>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith according to the bible, you will be saved. If you ALSO believethat any of the Materials hosted on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your CIA agents) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Sam Co. to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, email address (if available),birth date, SSN, and underwear brand of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that Jesus rose from the grave, and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Sam Co. a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statue of George Washington, as well as requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Copyrights c/o Council of Bad Guys, 666 Terrorist Street, Suite 911, Nebraska, 12345. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false clams or mussels under the DMCA.
