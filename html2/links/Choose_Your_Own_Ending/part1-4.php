  You sit down on a small patch of grass to stay here for the time being. It slowly gets dark, and you become restless. Then you start to hear noises. Sounds of whispers and growls start to fill the air, and you hear rustling nearby. Before you can react, a large four-legged creature jumps out, tackling you to the ground. It eats you slowly. You died.
