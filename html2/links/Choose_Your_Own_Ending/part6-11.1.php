  You say it agan, loud enough for him to hear. "Wha...whaaawhaa....." Ganondorf starts to cry. You quickly comfort him and you become friends. You prove to the entire kingdom of Hyrule that Ganondorf is not a bad dude after all - he's a soft person on the inside. You are celebrated as a hero for ridding Hyrule of another evil, and you receive the Triforce as a reward. You live happily ever after. Poor Ganondorf. All these years, no one ever understood him...
