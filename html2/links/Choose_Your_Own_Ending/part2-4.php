  You quickly grab the plant in your hand and pull it up out of the ground, roots and all. You brush dirt off your hands and smirk. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and a huge worm-like creature bursts out of the ground, looking at its prey - you. You have absolutely no way to defend yourself, and before you can think or react, its gaping mouth pummels you, swallowing you whole. You are burned alive by stomach acid. You die.
