  You walk inside the cave, cautious of your surroundings. You hear rustling behind you and run further into the cave to put some distance between you and the "thing". Before long you are lost and you can barely see ahead of you. Then you get stuck in some sort of thick web and you hear a voice behind you: 
<center><i>"Naughty little fly, why does it cry?</i></center>
<center><i>Caught in a web, soon you'll be......</i>dead<i>!"</i></center>
Before you can move or shout, you are hit from behind from what sems to be a stinger, and you are sucked dry by Shelob The Spider.
