TikTok ramen is a recipe originally made from a TikTok video. It's a short and quick dry noodle recipe focusing on flavor which I really like. While the original recipe uses everything bagel seasoning for most of the flavor, I find that I much prefer using sesame seeds instead (I also can't justify buying everything bagel seasoning because I would never use it for anything else). I also like to add a bit of sriracha to add a slightly spicy undertone.

## Ingredients

* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 eggs
* 1 package of instant ramen noodles (a Korean brand such as Nissin is preferred)
* 1 tablespoon of olive oil
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce (optional for a slight spicy flavor)
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Heat water to a boil in a pot. While the water is warming up, mince the garlic and lightly whisk the eggs in a bowl. They don't need to be extremely thorough because the eggs will be mixed in a pan later.
2. Cook the instant ramen noodles in boiling water. Slightly undercook it since the noodles will finish cooking in a pan. The noodles should be cooked in less than a minute. Remove the noodles from the pot and put them in a separate bowl to prevent noodle oversoaking and mushiness.
3. Heat the olive oil in a pan on low heat and add garlic. Once the garlic is soft, add in brown sugar, sriracha, and soy sauce.
4. Turn up the heat, add the noodles to the pan and mix. Then sprinkle sesame seeds or everything bagel seasoning on top.
5. Move the noodles to one side of the pan, then add the eggs and scramble. Remove from the stove once the egg is lightly set and mix.
