## Ingredients

* 2 cups rice
* 2 blocks of extra firm tofu
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp miso paste
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/3 tsp paprika
* 1 nori sheet (shredded, for garnish)
* kewpie mayo (for flavor)

## Instructions

1. Drain the tofu and pat dry with paper towel. Then vertically cut the block into halves, then trim each resulting block in the shape of a semi-circle to resemble salmon. Cut vertical slits into the top and bottom of the blocks.

2. Start to cook two cups of rice in a rice cooker.
3. In a bowl, mix the rice vinegar, soy sauce, miso paste, olive oil, water, garlic power, and paprika.
4. Heat a pan to medium heat. After submerging each slice of tofu salmon in the sauce, fry each in the pan until thoroughly browned and slightly blackened. You can reuse the remaining tofu pieces by frying them here as well.
5. When finished, fill a bowl with rice and add a tofu salmon block. Add a light drizzle of kewpie mayo and shredded nori, then mix and eat.
