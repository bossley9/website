I've been living in the US California bay area for a little over two years. Now that I'm moving away on to bigger and better things, I want to reflect on the past two years and share my experiences. What will I miss about the bay area, and what am I glad to leave?

## What will I miss?

* The food. The bay area has some of the best authentic foods I've ever had. Because it is a mixing pot of multiple cultures, it also features a lot of unique fusion foods and trending delicacies (for example, bubble tea largely took off in the bay before it spread elsewhere). The best seafood I've ever had has been from San Francisco. Some of my favorite places are [Garden Creamery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/garden-creamery-san-francisco-2), [Shizen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shizen-vegan-sushi-bar-and-izakaya-san-francisco), [Mama Lupitas](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mama-lupita-s-seafood-and-mexican-cocina-san-jose), [Hui Lau Shan](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hui-lau-shan-santa-clara), [Good Mong Kok](https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-mong-kok-bakery-san-francisco), and [La Mar Cocina Peruana](https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-mar-cebicher%C3%ADa-peruana-san-francisco-4).
* Encouragement in civic engagement. I lived in Milpitas and local government in Santa Clara county is very careful to promote voting and getting involved in the government to help better society. This is the first place I've lived in where they mail voter booklets to every house detailing the candidates' platforms for each primary and national election. There are ample resources provided to help everyone vote and make their voices heard.
* The weather. The bay really does have the best weather. It rarely rains and has beautiful sunrises and sunsets. The temperature generally stays within 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 - 20 degrees Celsius) all year round.
* The focus on environmentally friendly alternatives. It's normal to find distinct composting and recycling bins throughout the area. The primary electric company in California, PG&E, provides solar-powered options to those who want it. It's also much easier to find homes with solar panels.

## What am I glad to leave?

* The lack of nature (the "stone ocean"). Growing up in the Midwest, I am accustomed to woods, nature, and greenery. Living in a more densely populated region means nature is confined to a minimum as everything is surrounded by stone or concrete. Residential lawns barely exist and it's rare to find a tree growing next to someone's house. While there are a decent number of parks and forests residing outside the bay area city limits, I much prefer backyard woods and local community parks.
* The dust. In bay area reviews I never see it mentioned how dusty San Francisco and San Jose are. It is very easy for dirt to turn into dust because of the drought. I constantly have to vacuum or sweep my living space. Similarly, you can tell how long a car has been in a parking lot by how many layers of dust coat it.
* Expensive housing. This is one of the primary reasons I am leaving the area. Most apartments are twice as expensive as apartments elsewhere with reduced square footage. Most small <800 sq ft condos are $500K to $800K and most standard residential homes range from $1M to $6M. No thanks.
* Rude impatient drivers. Most drivers here are incredibly rude to pedestrians and to other drivers. Drivers are quick to blare car horns at each other for the smallest lane change. I can't tell you how many times I've almost gotten run over by a car as a pedestrian walking when the walk sign is on for me to walk - and the driver glares at me as if I made a mistake. If that wasn't enough, the drivers are very impatient and seem inexperienced. Drivers weave in and out of traffic and enjoy cutting each other off. I used to think the quality of drivers in the Midwest was bad until I lived here.
