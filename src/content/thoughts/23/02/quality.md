The hardest obstacle I encounter when I create content is self criticism. I'm a natural perfectionist and hate striving for anything less than my best work in all that I do.

However, this aspect of myself can be a double-edged sword. I can't tell you how many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of half-written articles I have sitting on my computer waiting for me to make up my mind. There's plenty of guitar covers I can't bear to see myself upload. Even entire video commentaries, gaming videos, and vlogs that I can't bring myself to post. I still have to finish my video essay on the beauty of Arcane's artstyle. Or my game review of Elden Ring, my favorite game of 2022. Or my article on asymptotic runtime. Or my cover of Playing God by Polyphia. All of this hesitation because I just don't think it's "good enough".

I've somehow made myself my own worst enemy.

Why do I do this to myself?

I'm trying to get better at publishing content that is simply "okay". There's no one I need to impress but myself. Sometimes I need to remember that it's okay to only be okay.

Content doesn't have to be perfect to be great.

I'm hoping that this year to post more work regardless of how "good" I think it is. And to you, dear reader, I cannot thank you enough for your support.
