I'm busy, I said.
I took off my boots, hung up my coat
And fell into a bed that wasn't mine.
I remember the scars you had lining your ribcage
I even traced my fingers along them
Who caused them? I can't remember
I had to help you into jackets, hold your arms down
Yet you held mine down in the end.

But the scariest part of it all is that
My memories are slowly fading away with age
I can't quite remember who caused them
I might even forget your name.
