When waves clash, they clash.

Small ones writhe and foam, inevitably consumed by larger, heavier
waves, flowing this way and that, up to their untimely end upon
jagged rocks of distant shores.

Waves hold no emotion and no memory, flowing this way, rocking that
way, lashing out angrily, then subsiding into nothing.

I continuously drift further and further from the shoreline, until
the coast is no longer visible, and I'm somewhere new entirely.

Or,
I might drown and sink forever.

Waves lap into each other, spinning me around and turning me
upside-down, until I'm deep beneath the turbulent waves.

Now I can finally rest.
