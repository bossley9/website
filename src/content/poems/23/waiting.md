Lights continue to drift across the vacancy of the sky.
It's nights like these that I feel the emptiness consume the air
As I recall nights past with old friends
Waiting at the train station, departing one by one
Until none of us remain.
From there the timeline diverged:
Trains transporting us to separate destinies.
Once we embark on a journey
There is no one and nothing holding us back
Until we arrive at our destination.
