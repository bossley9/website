It's absurd to think that this system works
Just pawns on a vast empty grid
Interlocked, interweaved, and disconnected
Anthropomorphism is not a phenomenon.

Primal emotions wrestling instinctual love
Nostalgia re-presenting itself like clockwork
What we attribute ourselves haunting
Amasses to ghastly proportion.

Burdens are always hinderances
Deadweight on an empty station
But this one, it keeps clinging to me
This one I can't get rid of.
