So suddenly,
That everyone in the world is free
Opinion keeps swaying
Back and forth,
Back, and forth,
Stuck within and buried alive
Why can't I just die
Who built these rules, and who
Wrote these stone tablets
It's no wonder it's all a mess
Just breath a little
Feel a little, and then
Everything also will be free
