That cold, dark gaze from a conceptual maze.
Following a chime and causing a climb.
Regardless of grit, write one's writ.
Seeing a star, unbearably far.
Unattainable feat, so time to eat.
What about you? What would you do?
Laughed and cried, you already tried.
Giving up hope is the only way to cope.
Willing to rice, coming at a price.
Stop looking at your phone. Leave me alone.
Inside I'm falling,
Falling,
Falling,
Falling,
Fa

Down.
The thing I dread is now already dead.
Because really what I see is just a reflection of me.
