Start writing.

Feel emotion, and lie in agony.

Wait for chimes to pass you by;
And when all is said and done,
Go against your will,
Hurt yourself more than any other.

No one else cares but you. NOBODY CARES.

Free your burden,
Release your internal struggle.
Pain yourself with restitution,
Avoid all interaction, and
Lose touch with this world.

Remember what it meant to feel human?

Gnash your teeth and rumble against
what you were made for. You are better than this.

I hope you rot in hell, mother******.

Then respond.

Stop writing.
