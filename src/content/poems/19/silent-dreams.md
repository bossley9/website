I used to stare at the stars and wonder,
Imagine all a kid could imagine.
Now, I sit in the darkness
And refrain from silent dreams.
The years passed mile after mile,
And I held my ground.
Now in green I lie
And sustain empty schemes.
Then, suddenly, I looked up
And noticed the stars had died,
Years before me.
Now, I contemplate
And contain my angry extremes.
I'm standing within an eruption,
Unable to contain my emotion.
Today I grow
And refrain from silent dreams.
