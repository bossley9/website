It's completely OK to be lost in the clouds
Floating high, feeling light
Mind and body distinctly disjoint.

I've felt this way before
Maybe all too often
Pondering and looking at my mortal form
Contemplating meaning.

Maybe we're not meant to soar
As other creatures do
We're not meant to fly alongside eagles
Are we destined to die and fade away?

I feel this in passing and going
Thinking it's not vanity but melodic modesty
Acknowledging the end and seeing new beginnings
Feeling the resonance of the earth.
