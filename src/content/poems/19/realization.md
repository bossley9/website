When you look into my eyes, you see a soft light. I resonate
with that.

When I glance at my own reflection, I see empty gaping holes
where my eyes should have been.  
And, inside, I see sadness rooted deeply in my character.  
I see what was once an innocent creature become a monster.  
And I see fear.
