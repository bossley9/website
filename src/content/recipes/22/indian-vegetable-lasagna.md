This lasagna gives an Indian flair to one of my favorite foods.

## Ingredients

Inner Layer:

* 1 white onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp chili paste (for flavor)
* 1 tsp cumin

> The following ingredients can be any type of diced vegetable. These will dictate the texture of the layers. I prefer these ingredients:

* 1/2 cup tomatoes
* 1/2 cup peas
* 1/2 cup diced zucchini
* 1/2 cup green bell pepper
* 1/2 cup mushrooms

Outer Layer:

* 1 egg
* 3/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
* 3 cups shredded mozzerella cheese

Noodle Layer:

* a small quantity of olive oil
* 1 24oz jar of tomato sauce
* oven ready lasagna noodles (I used about 9 noodles)

## Instructions

1. Chop the onion and mince the garlic.
2. Finely dice the inner layer vegetable ingredients. The consistency of the ingredients will largely influence the consistency of the layers (if it's chunky, the lasagna will be chunky). I prefer a very fine dicing.
3. In a pan over medium heat, carmelize the onion. Then add the garlic, chili paste, cumin, and inner layer veggies and cook for around 5 minutes. It should not be a wet mixture.
4. Take it off heat and let it cool completely. The temperature and dryness of the mixture will dictate the consistency of the entire lasagna. I recommend pouring the mixture into a mixing bowl and placing it in the fridge for 30 minutes, otherwise the lasagna will be too watery.
5. Add ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan into a bowl with a whisked egg. This will be the outer layer.

To assemble:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Add a small bit of olive oil to the bottom of a 9x9 inch dish.
3. Cover the surface with a few spoonfuls of the tomato sauce.
4. Cover the surface with cooked noodles.
5. Cover the surface with the inner layer, then the outer layer.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the top layer is the outer layer and no more layers can be added.
7. Cover a sheet of aluminum foil with a dash of olive oil and wrap the pan with the foil.
8. Bake for 50 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes. Then let the pan rest for 15 minutes before serving.
