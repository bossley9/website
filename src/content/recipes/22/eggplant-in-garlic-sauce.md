This is a standard eggplant recipe that is a great side dish and pairs well with rice.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup water
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* 1‚ÅÑ2 tsp garlic powder
* 3 chinese eggplants
* 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1 green onion

## Instructions

1. Add the water and cornstarch to a medium-sized bowl and whisk the two together. Then add the soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, and garlic powder, then mix and set aside.
2. Chop each of the eggplants horizontally into 3 sections, then chop each section vertically into quarters. You should end up with many eggplant strips.
3. In a pan over medium heat, pour olive oil and place the eggplants in the pan (you may need to put in a few at a time if your pan is not very big). Sprinkle the eggplants with salt and pepper.
4. Mince the garlic and add to the pan with the eggplant.
5. After a few minutes (once the garlic has been added), pour the sauce into the pan.
6. Cut up the green onion and mix it with the eggplants. Then let it simmer for around 5 minutes until the eggplants are very tender.
