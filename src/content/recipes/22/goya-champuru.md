## Ingredients

* medium firm tofu
* two small bitter melons (they say bumpier melons give better flavor but I can't tell the difference)
* 2 large eggs
* olive oil for cooking
* pinches of salt/pepper
* 1 tbsp soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Cut the tofu into large ice-cube sized chunks and wrap the chunks in paper towels with pressure to squeeze out any additional moisture.
2. Cut the two small bitter melons in half length-wise and gut the seeds inside. Don't be alarmed if the insides look yellow or red - those are natural colors. Then cut each half into semi-circle slices.
3. Rinse the melon slices in a strainer and cover them with generous pinches of salt to draw out the bitterness.
4. Whisk the eggs and set aside.
5. In a pan on medium heat, cook the dried tofu chunks in olive oil until they begin to golden. Then take out and set aside.
6. Rinse the bitter melon to remove the salt.
7. Add the bitter melon and cook on medium heat (preferably with a lid) until the green color has dulled significantly. If the melon slices still have dark skin, they will be very bitter.
8. Add soy sauce and add the tofu chunks. Then add a few pinches of salt and pepper and pour in the eggs. Mix for a minute until the egg has set, then serve.
