Coconut banana pancakes are a perfect way to start the day. They require little time to prepare and make a very healthy breakfast. This recipe produces around 4 medium-sized pancakes.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup plain flour
* 3/4 cup canned coconut milk
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 tbsp coconut oil
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 2 tsp sugar
* pinch of salt
* 1 banana

## Instructions

1. Place all ingredients except the banana in a mixing bowl and whisk to combine until the mixture is perfectly smooth.
2. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat, then ladle about 2 tbsp of batter for each pancake. Cook until the edges are set, then flip and cook until the other side is nicely browned. Add banana slices over the top of the pancakes once they have been flipped once.
