A lentil loaf is a vegan meatloaf that (in my opinion) tastes better than a real meatloaf. It serves well as a side dish for practically anything.

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups water
* 1 cup uncooked lentils
* 1/3 cup water (optional)
* 3 tbsp flaxseed
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion
* 1 cup mushrooms
* 1 cup celery
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/4 ketchup
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 3/4 cup old fashion oats
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 tsp basil flakes
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Combine 2 1/2 cups water and the lentils in a pot and bring it to a boil. Once it is boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer until all the liquid is absorbed and the lentils are soft (around 30 min).
2. (optional) Mix 1/3 cup water and flaxseed together in a bowl, then set aside.
3. Chop the onion, mushrooms, celery, and mince the garlic. If the vegetables are chopped very finely, the consistency of the resulting loaf will be very smooth.
3. Heat the olive oil, onion, mushrooms, celery, and garlic in a pan over medium heat and stir until the vegetables are softened (around 10 min).
4. Preheat the oven to 350 Fahrenheit (175 Celsius) and very lightly coat a loaf pan with any extra olive oil.
5. In a separate pan on low heat, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, and soy sauce and stir until the resulting sauce is thoroughly mixed (around 3 min)
6. Fill the loaf pan with the cooked lentils, cooked vegetables, flaxseed mixture, as well as the oats, flour, basil, pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Mix all ingredients together finely. Most meatloaf recipes will call for a food processor or blender here but I think a good spatula or meat mallet works just as well (if not better). Pour in the sauce and mix well.
7. Bake the loaf pan in the oven for around 35 min.
