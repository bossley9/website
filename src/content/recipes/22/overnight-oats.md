Overnight oats are a perfect way to start the day. Overnight oats are a variation of oatmeal where oats soak in some form of liquid overnight and create a healthy juicy snack in the morning. It can be consumed hot or cold but it tastes best cold in my experience. I usually eat overnight oats every morning to wake myself up.

Overnight oats are a unique recipe because most of the ingredients are interchangeable. If almond milk doesn't suit your tastes, try lowfat milk or coconut milk. If you dislike chia seeds, try flaxseeds. Below is one of my favorite ingredient combinations.

## Ingredients

* 2 bananas
* 1 cup old fashioned oats
* 1 tbsp of chia seeds
* 1 tsp of honey
* 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk
* 1 cup fresh fruit chunks of choice (strawberries, blueberries, or golden dragonfruit recommended)

## Instructions

1. Mash the bananas with a fork. The smoother the pulp, the better.
2. Mix all ingredients in the listed order in a sealable container and put it in a refrigerator. I would recommend pouring the mixture into two 16oz mason jars for convenience but a standard plastic container works just as well.
3. Wait for 12 hours for the oats to congeal.
4. Eat warm or cold.
