What you didn't ignite
Can't be called fire
What you haven't touched
Can't be called sapphire
Ah you, you're finally here
As soon as we meet
My heart breaks into bits
The whole world crumbles
Your beauty is an unsheathed blade
What you didn't kill
Has no reason to live
What you didn't shatter
Can never be patched together
If I have to die in this life
I must die in your hand
