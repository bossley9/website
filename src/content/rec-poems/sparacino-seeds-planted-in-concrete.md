"Are you happy?"
"In all honesty? No. But I am curious — I am
curious in my sadness, and I am curious in my
joy. I am everseeking, everfeeling. I am in awe
of the beautiful moments life gives us, and I am
in awe of the difficult ones. I am transfixed by
grief, by growth. It is all so stunning, so rich,
and I will never convince myself that I cannot
be somber, cannot be hurt, cannot be over-
joyed. I want to feel it all — I don't want to
cover it up or numb it. So no, I am not happy. I
am open, and I wouldn't have it any other
way."
