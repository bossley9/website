The internet was my childhood refuge.
It's where I practice still. Erase
my browsing history.

  At the strip club, a friend leans over to say
the search for a moral politic is a failure.
How it mirrors a religious pursuit, that fervor.

I agree, then disagree. I'm watching my favorite dancer,
feeling the ghost of my teenage body.
A river rushing superimposed boundaries.

Do to me what sunlight does to a river.
