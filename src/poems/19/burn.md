Burn
Burn to the ground
All the fields
All that is, was, and will be
Reap
Reap my soul
From the inside
Look within and tear apart
Tear
Tear drops
Falling adrift in oceans
Numb, bleeding, and cold
Trust
Trust me
Remember long ago
Feel something more
Yield
Yield before me
Rocks of the earth
Erode to dust, like the world before it
