title: "As Long As There Is Love, There Will Be Grief"
author: "Heidi Priebe"

The grief of time passing, of life moving on half-finished, of
empty spaces that were once bursting with the laughter and
energy of people we loved.

As long as there is love there will be grief because grief is
love's natural continuation.

It shows up in the aisles of stores we once frequented, in the
half-finished bottle of wine we pour out, in the whiff of
cologne we get two years after they've been gone.

Grief is a giant neon sign, protruding through everything,
pointing everywhere, broadcasting loudly, "Love was here."
In the finer print, quietly, "Love still is."
