Surely it's in the woods.

When birds perch and sing,

when wind passes through,

a single timid branch resolutely looks aside

and perversely feigns indifference.

But the branch knows that a blue "something" exists,

knows that something abides well beyond

other treetops and leaves.

Surely it's in the woods: that so solitary branch.
