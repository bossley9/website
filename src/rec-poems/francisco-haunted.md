On days like this,
I am the house and
the ghost,

responsible for my
own haunting.

My brain is a revolver
with "Am I good enough?"
in every chamber.

So I turn into a factory that
only makes the word "yes"
and I say it until it can easily
be mistaken for the truth,

but my voice shakes
and the answer still sounds
like a question.
