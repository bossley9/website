title: Why You Should Use RSS (Why Modern Social Media Sucks)
desc: "In this post I hope to discourage everyone away from traditional social media platforms
      due to their toxicity and sexualization. As an objectively superior alternative, I
      recommend RSS, an ad-free content streamlined system to ensure only the content you
      intend to see will be shown to you."

I don't hide the fact that I absolutely despise social media.

Let me explain my reasoning. I don't necessarily believe that social media is inherently bad; 
rather, I believe its practicality has strayed too far from its actual intended purpose.

So what is the purpose of social media? Or, even broader, what _is_ social media?

I would define a social media platform as a technologically-built platform intended for internet 
communication, whether through forums, data sharing (images, videos), or instant messaging. 
It's an umbrella term under which all the major contenders (instagram, facebook, messenger, 
tiktok, snapchat, etc) share a common trait. So what is the purpose of these platforms?

From a consumer perspective, I believe that the purpose of a social media platform is to bring
the average user enjoyment and allow a user to connect with other people across the globe.
This is what I would call the _intent_ of social media. With the intent of social media 
clarified, we need to ask ourselves: _does this intent hold true in practice?_ I argue that it
**does not** hold true in practice for most social media platforms, and I want to give a few
reasons why I've mostly stopped using modern social media, and what social media alternatives
I would suggest.

First, I want to explain why modern social media fails to bring the average user enjoyment. From
a completely subjective point of view, I would be willing to state that an average person does
not receive any gratification from scrolling through their feed on Instagram for one hour. In
fact, most social media platforms are built around a capitalist idea of likes, upvotes, or
comments. We receive instant _gratification_ the moment we receive a like or upvote on one of
our posts. But is it _really_ gratification, or is it the relief that other people care about
our actions?

Last fall I read an [amazing article](/thoughts/rss-comprehensive-overstimulation.pdf) (I 
recommend reading its entirety) written by Gregory Robson regarding the overabundance of 
stimuli present in our daily lives. Even under the COVID-19 quarantine, we are bombarded with 
notifications, phone vibrations, emails, noises, lights, and signs that fill the sensory 
center of our brains. Robson argues in his article that while each individual proponent we
sense may be inherently good (for example, a mobile phone), the combination of these items
actually lower our overall social utility. I agree with his statement wholeheartedly and I 
believe it holds true _especially_ in regards to modern social media. With each social media 
platform we join, our attention is subsequently divded into notifications specific to each 
platform, likes for a certain photo on instagram, views on a video on tiktok, et cetera, 
et cetera. Because of this division of attention, a single like on a photo or video gives no 
one instant gratitude. As the scale of these platforms increase, we expect the scale of our 
gratification to increase as well, and we begin to expect 400, 500, 700 likes on each photo. 
We expect thousands of video views, 50 comments, and when we fail to achieve these hardly 
realistic goals, we begin to develop feelings of discontent and depression. I argue that 
social media platforms **do not** give anyone a feeling of gratification, but rather, 
**a feeling of discontent**, because our expectations exceed reality as a platform scales. 
And as such, scrolling for an hour on instagram will actually make any user feel less content 
with their social media profile maintenance. It's a mind game of who can get the most likes, 
the most views, the greatest upvotes, and this mentality is unhealthy and harmful. While each 
individual platform may be intended to give its users connection and feelings of gratitude,
it does the opposite in practice.

I also believe that the content featured on these platforms do not reflect the intent of the 
platform creators, and I'll use Instagram as a prime example. I remember using Instagram for 
the first time in 2014 after some consistent peer pressure to "get Instagram" to "check out 
cool photography" and "aesthetic food photos". In 2020, I can't say that I see much of these 
things anymore, and only a remnant remains of the original Instagram content. Because of the 
"popularity pressure", people want to show their face. They feel a need to be recognized for 
their likes, or associate their likes to their body image. Thus, the content on Instagram 
spirals downward into a battle of who can show the most sexualized photo of themselves to 
receive upvotes. With this pressure to conform, the idea of displaying art or beauty in 
nature is replaced with highly sexualized content consumed by a younger generation. Combined 
with a pressure to receive likes, users feel a need to boast about their personal lives - 
photos of a relationship, material wealth, and personal beauty. There's nothing objectively 
beneficial about this shift in content creation. Don't believe me? Try scrolling on Instagram 
for as little as ten minutes, and you can easily confirm the shift in content creation.

But even if social media content could be deemed morally acceptable, I believe corporations 
controlling these platforms also play a hand in my disgust for social media. The sole business 
purpose of a social media platform is to generate revenue. Regarding a "free to use" platform, 
the only foreseeable way a corporation can generate profit is through ad revenue. This means 
littering a user's feed with irritating content the user did not purposefully subscribe to.

So the question now is, _how does a corporation change a user's feed whilst keeping the user 
"entertained" on their platform?_ And the magic answer is **personalization**. We notice if we 
see fifty diaper ads on instagram in a row, but if it displays ads for Youtubers I know? I 
don't care. And it's how they personalize our feeds that could be viewed as morally 
impermissible.

Most sites tend to use cookies, bots, and other analytics services to better personalize their 
platform towards your desires. As a web developer, I can confirm how many undercover invasions
of privacy a company can incorporate into a site. Apps can 
[use your location](https://www.awesomehowto.com/track-someone-on-google-maps/). 
They can [listen to your voice](https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/privacy/is-instagram-listening-conversations/). 
They can record when you scroll down the page. They can record what posts you've viewed.
They can record 
[what buttons you click on](https://www.monsterinsights.com/how-does-google-analytics-work-beginners-guide/), 
what posts you've liked, and 
[more](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-listening/). At my internship this summer I 
learned of [mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/), a technology that allows a site to screen 
record a user's cursor while the user is browsing the site. The list of analytics goes on and 
on. We've become so comfortable with these invasions of privacy that we've become complacent,
neglecting our privacy completely. I don't believe that any company should have rights to spy 
on my personal life because I want to message my friends or look at art. For this reason 
alone, I want to leave social media completely.

All in all, I believe that most modern social media platforms are terrible. They don't give us
any gratification, they host often sexualized and inappropriate content, and they often breach
our privacy. This is a terrible system for us to allow younger generations to thrive on, and 
it needs to change.

By now you should have seen my title for this extended rant and you're probably wondering _what 
the heck RSS is_, but I'll explain RSS in a bit. Let me preface by saying that regardless of
the state of modern social media, I still want to socially connect with my peers. By forgoing 
my usage of social media, how can I keep contact with my friends? How can I stay up to date 
on news? I think there's more than a few answers to this question.

First, it's time to **stop letting your technology control you**, and instead, **for you to control your technology**. Over the past few weeks, I've been turning my phone off completely and leaving it in one of my desk compartments. The amount of dead time I've been aimlessly scrolling on 
Reddit or Instagram has become immediately apparent, and in the past week alone, I've probably
saved hundreds of hours putting my time towards more beneficial hobbies and skills. I think we 
instinctively glue our minds to our devices and forget about the real world around us. I'm not 
saying you should never use social media. I'm saying that you can use social media in a healthy
amount, and change your feed content to reflect your interests. I've gotten used to checking my 
phone only once or twice per day, then turning it off for the remainder of the day (_yes, completely off_), and in the 
rare cases I'm expecting a phone call, I'll leave it on. Likewise, I've started to unfollow a 
lot of accounts and people, and started to follow content more aligned with my interests and 
values. I know some of these are my friends, but as a minor shoutout and plug, I really 
appreciate accounts like 
[stevenoclock](https://www.instagram.com/stevenoclock/), 
[0t0nai](https://www.instagram.com/0t0nai/),
[_jolie.jpeg](https://www.instagram.com/_jolie.jpeg),
[banksy](https://www.instagram.com/bansky),
[frankchi](https://www.instagram.com/frankchi),
and I really appreciate communities such as
[r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) (it's not actual porn),
[r/archlinux](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux),
[r/poetry](https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry), and others. People should follow and appreciate
the things they personally enjoy rather than following what other people enjoy.

And now I'll talk a bit about RSS and why I've starting using [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/)
as my primary social media platform (if you can even call it _social media_). In the early years
of the twenty first century, the concept of _following_ or _subscribing_ to a profile or site
didn't really exist, and the only way to follow content was to actively check that site. RSS, or
_Really Simple Syndication_, is a content feed that allows a user to add sites and profiles to
their feed, and all the content aggregated from these sites will be streamlined into a single
source. How it works is that most popular sites host code files specific to an article, user, 
or profile. In fact, you can view the RSS feed for my thoughts 
[here](https://sam.bossley.us/feeds/thoughts.xml). Once you gather all these urls for content
you wish to follow, you can use an _RSS reader_ to input all urls, and it will streamline that
content for you, free of ads and useless information you don't care for. The concept of RSS used
to be very popular in the early 2000s, but has since become obsolete with the creation of modern
social media; however, I still believe it holds more potential than any existing social media
site today. With RSS, you don't have to use multiple social media apps to view the posts of
each account you follow, and instead, it is possible to aggregate all these posts onto one site.
Using Newsboat, here is an example of my last article.

![Newsboat displaying my prevous article of Steel Ball Run](/thoughts/rss-newsboat.png)

I think newsboat is very minimal, but I'm able to aggregate my feeds into a simple interface 
where I can view only the content I want to see. The beauty of RSS is that there are many 
RSS readers, and you can choose which reader you would like to use to aggregate all content. 
I personally suggest [feedly](https://feedly.com/), a user-friendly modern RSS reader.

![Feedly diplaying my articles](/thoughts/rss-feedly.png)

Most modern sites offer RSS urls for a user to subscribe to their content. Using RSS, you can 
subscribe to exactly the content you wish to see without ads and social media overhead.

It's hard for me to describe how effective RSS is without providing examples, so below is a 
list of all feeds I currently follow. You're welcome to use my feeds to see why you might 
consider using RSS.

So I'll close my thoughts with a few questions that everyone should ask themselves. Do you 
enjoy your time spent on a specific social media platform? And if not, why not? And, more
importantly, are you in control of your technology? Or does your technology control you?
