One of the introductory assignments for my capstone course this semester was to capture high quality digital photos of myself and make them "artsie to some degree". The prompt was open to interpretation. I thought to myself,

_this would be a good opportunity for me to take photos with [Paul (@apaullo7)](https://www.instagram.com/apaullo7/) somewhere near Columbus since we haven't really gone out anywhere (except for shopping) during the pandemic._

I asked Paul to choose what he wanted me to wear, and I ended up clothed in a tan brown turtleneck, a sleeveless gray hoodie, and an old green wind jacket. I wore gray Vans skater shoes.

After walking around High St and Lane Ave for a few blocks, we settled on taking photographs near the intersection of High and Maynard. Here's a few of the original photos. Although the originals photos were taken in very high resolution, I scaled down the photo resolutions here to optimize the loading of the photos on the website.

I wanted to try something different for each photo. In the first photo I chose a picture of myself without a mask and decided to do a standard vector conversion. Although I scrapped the background completely in the process, I thought the graffiti to my right added a nice accent to the overall feel of the vector and decided to keep it. I paired it with a monochrome blue background. The result is below. This was done in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

For the second photo I wanted to choose a photo in which I had no mask and was looking at the camera. I didn't want to make drastic changes so I simply changed the background focus to use a radial blur. To prevent my face and legs from blurring, I use an inverse select on the outline of my body. This was done in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

The final photo used the stairs as a means to split myself into segments. Each segment was pasted separately at slightly different angles on a white background. This was also done in GIMP.
