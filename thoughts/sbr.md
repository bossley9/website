desc: This is a summary of my thoughts after reading the seventh part of Jojo, Steel 
      Ball Run. While it wasn't necessarily my favorite part, there were a lot of 
      components I thoroughly enjoyed, especially the art. I've displayed a few of 
      my favorite panels.

I spent most of last night and this morning finishing the seventh installment of the _Jojo_ series.

While I have many praises and critiques to mention regarding this part, I don't want to delve into too much detail since I've already spent a decent amount of thought reviewing [the previous part, _Stone Ocean_](https://sam.bossley.us/thoughts/stone-ocean). But I do want to give a brief overview of my thoughts. As always, if you haven't read it and plan on reading it, I highly suggest doing so before continuing, as I'll be revealing potential spoilers.

I think the pacing was absolutely fantastic. The anticipation and stakes grew with each encounter, and in comparison to _Stone Ocean_, it was very easy to tell at any point in time the progress of the main characters (either through number of collected corpse parts, or the stage within the Steel Ball Run race). I also liked many of the characters. Gyro and Diego both grew dynamically as characters, and they were perhaps my favorites.

I think the underlying plot of the entire part is so ironically comical. Regardless of the intensity or anticipation in each battle or encounter, the story revolves around the president of the United States trying to piece together the body of Jesus Christ. It's a dark plot centered around a completely comical concept, and I think that's why I like it so much.

But my favorite part of the entire story (and the reason I'm writing this short review) is the atmosphere of the story and the art. Set in the late 1800's, this story follows the main characters and their journey through the wild west. That fact alone makes the villains more enticing to me because they are more mysterious, more powerful, and darker. The use of guns in addition to stands makes the story feel more genuine because characters can die realistic deaths, regardless of the stand.

The panel art reinforces that, and below I've tried to compile a few of my favorite panels. Some of them made me laugh out loud. Some made me excited for an ensuing battle. Some were sad. Others just looked extremely cool. I think that of all the parts I've read or watched so far, _Steel Ball Run_ contains some of the best art.

| Diego | |

![dio wrying](/thoughts/sbr-wry.jpg)
> I laughed at one of Dio's first appearances. Even if the Dio from this world is completely different from the Dio everyone knows and loves, I think Diego's subtle shared characteristics make him a more recognizeable character, and thus a better character. It's the best form of acceptable fan service.

| Catch the Rainbow | |

![mountain tim's death](/thoughts/sbr-mountain-tim-death.jpg)
> If Blackmore's _Catch the Rainbow_ isn't the coolest stand, I don't know what is.

| Ringo |

| ![ringo's showdown with gyro](/thoughts/sbr-ringo-showdown.jpg) |
| ![first encounter with ringo](/thoughts/sbr-ringo-first-encounter.jpg) |
> Likewise, Ringo is just a cool character. He reminds me of a mix between a wild western outlaw and a kpop star.

| Gyro | |

| ![gyro leaning on a chair](/thoughts/sbr-gyro-standing.jpg) | ![Gyro and his teddy bear](/thoughts/sbr-teddy-bear.jpg) |
![gyro making 420 gesture](/thoughts/sbr-gyro-420.jpg)
> If Gyro having a teddy bear isn't the cutest thing, I don't know what is.

| Funny Valentine | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Funny Valentine with his back scarred in the resemblance of an American flag](/thoughts/sbr-valentine-america.jpg) | ![dirty deeds done dirt cheap stand](/thoughts/sbr-d4c.jpg) |
![Valentine's showdown with Johnny](/thoughts/sbr-valentine-johnny.jpg)
> Valentine is one of the best villains a story could possibly ask for. He's clearly intimidating, and his stand is one of the most powerful stands to exist. He also ironically has scars resembling the American flag on his back.

And, of course, there's other various characters and cool scenes to think about.

Overall, while there were some flaws regarding the story, I think _Steel Ball Run_ is a great addition to the JJBA universe and is one of my favorite parts.
