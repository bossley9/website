            <p>You try so hard to get help, to feel the love</p>

            <p>Never remember because they never lost</p>

            <p>Why does it occur, and only to you</p>
            <p>The world will continue to forget without you</p>
            <p>Set ablaze by emotional impediment</p>
            <p>So easy to follow the waves, don't conform</p>
            <p>The feeling no one else will ever feel,</p>
            <p>Is prominent, restricting, provoking</p>
            <p>What plan of action does one take?</p>
            <p>The world will never remember you</p>
            <p>Don't hesitate to end your life.</p>

            <p>I remember the doors long ago,</p>
            <p>Deep, dark, distant and repressed.</p>
            <p>But now the doors beckon.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>I remember the time spent on trivialities,</p>
            <p>The laughter, the tenderness, the love.</p>
            <p>Now the future is grim.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>I remember the masquerade.</p>
            <p>The movements, the ignorance, the sillhouettes.</p>
            <p>Now that moment is forgotten.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Broken Roots.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>Emptiness remains, and efficacy is absent.</p>
            <p>Change the time.</p>
            <br /><br />

            <em>The Path</em>
            <br /><span>02/07/17</span><br /><br />
            <p>Forgotten forlorn path,</p>
            <p>Emerging from dark and distant destruction.</p>
            <p>Worn, cracked, faded, eroded.</p>
            <p>The memory still stands.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>The silence of the air, drowned by the beating of the drums.</p>
            <p>The taste of the hollow, stifled air,</p>
            <p>Depriving the lung and starving the soul.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>Whispering winds soaring through gaps,</p>
            <p>Halcyon days turned to misty nights;</p>
            <p>Wondering when the light turned to dark,</p>
            <p>When the isolation consumed me,</p>
            <p>When it all became quicksand.</p>

            <p>What is this treachery?</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>I must recall that I am in fact the Angel of Death,</p>
            <p>That no one can control the black plague of my mind,</p>
            <p>No one can reverse my cruel doomed Fate;</p>

            <p>Why does all this evil reside in me?</p>

            <p>What makes a man more relatable in essence and in virtue?</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>I gazed into the distant clouds of forgotten past,</p>
            <p>The realm of dreams and broken reality;</p>
            <p>I dwelled upon the counsciousness of my dead heart,</p>
            <p>The soul of darkness within the storm;</p>
            <p>I savor its taste, I yearn for love,</p>
            <p>But I find none, misery takes its place;</p>
            <p>The shadows in my soul strengthen and harm me,</p>
            <p>The burdens in my heart grow heavy with rust.</p>
            <p>I find no reat at this place.</p>
            <p>I find no joy in this place.</p>
            <p>I find no love in this place.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>Once again, the dream is forgotten as quickly as it was remembered,</p>
            <p>The realm vanished in the dust;</p>
            <p>The storm is no more,</p>
            <p>The clouds have dissipated.</p>

            <p>I deserve death.</p>
            <p>I am the one who brought havoc amongst choas. I created my demons. I molded my fears. I created my regrets by mine own uncontrolled recklessness.</p>
            <p>My own blood must be the price. The words, regrets, and fear cut deep into my skin. I am alone. I am struggling beneath this burden. I am alone. My words and feelings are obseqious to the Shadowcasters above me. I am alone.</p>
            <p>Will it end?</p>
            <p>That madness... it ensues. That devil... it pursues. Day after day tears are shed, sorrows released into the Great Chasm, sucked in by its darkness and despair. No one hears me within mine own cage. What have I done?</p>
            <p>I have lost those dear to me. I have broken their backs, crushed hearts. The libertine reality of the world overwhelms. I have lost the battle of life and brace for the front of death. I am truly alone. There is no one to console me in my time of fear and grief. I cannot be helped. I face fearful odds and dastardly powers of lore. There is no cure for putrid regret. The stench of regret. And blood.</p>
            <p>I am alone. The memories plague me. The visions haunt me. I tried to run away from them. The denial sinks in, and I realize there is no solution, no cure to this sadness. I am locked in a cage. The banshees encircle me laughing and shouting, the screams unbearable. I am the only one in this world. I am the only one in the void, in the pit. I have lost one piece of my soul to greed, then the other to primitive desire. A third I have lost to boasting, and a fourth to the unleashed evil in the world. And many others. These are only a few.</p>
            <p>Suicide is only a means. The result is inevitable. The pain, the contortion, the blind anger, the regret. Regret is more powerful than any other Being in this age of Man. I am doing this not because I wish to, but because there is no other way. I am drowning in evil and shame, regret and fear.<br /> I can't get out.</p>
            <p>I can't get out.</p>
            <p>Let me out!</p>

            <p>What am I to you?</p>
            <p>To him who has no knowledge of punishment, no understanding of cruelty, let it be known.</p>
            <p>Let him bear witness to the lies and deceit that veil him from the truth of the light.</p>
            <p>Let him break the air of falleness and melt the hearts of stone.</p>
            <p>Let him glance upon the folly of mankind and the treachery of his companions.</p>
            <p>Revealing betrayal is richer than revenge; presenting treason more valuable than gold.</p>
            <p>What does a man become without these memories? He is nothing; without worth.</p>
            <p>He is a soft breeze in the summer; occasional to appear; transient at passing.</p>
            <p>But what is man?</p>
            <p>What is death?</p>

            <p>This is it.</p>
            <p>The final moments.</p>
            <p>Most people always seem to ask why you did it because you had a perfect life, but what people don't see is that these suicidal thoughts, these evil demons, do not sprout from all the good things in life. They develop from the dark moments in life. The black things that most people don't see and wouldn't ever know about until they had walked in the shoes of the individual. There is great struggle and the demons fight for control and push and grab at your body and you run for cover, you run away but there is nowhere to hide. You are devoured inside and consumed with darkness and the light fades from view and your companions are oblivious. Blinded to that fact. The fact that every day you go through hell and back and it is unseen by everyone. They brush these comments away. No one seeks. No one understands. You are lost within a sea of thoughts, of swirling thoughts and you can't stop the temptation to give up, to free yourself from the boundage, the fetters, the shackles.</p>
            <p>But you can't.</p>
            <p>No matter how hard you try.</p>
            <p>There's no way out.</p>
            <p>There is a dead feeling inside, a feeling of loss and lonliness. There is an abyss inside but everyone is outside. They smile and reach, to pull you out, but you are too far away. You see everyone outside the realms of your mind having fun and smiling and laughing, but you are isolated within your own impenetrable fortress. And there's no way out. Words and force have no effect on this desolation. The only true way out is death. There may be moments where we soar, we fly above the realms of darkness... but they are only misguiding thoughts, transient emotions of facade.</p>
            <p>All you see are potential deaths, the loss, the hurt, the pain. Nothing else penetrates the black bound code of the soul.</p>
            <p>There's no other way. Nothing in life can fulfill the ever-growing abyss, the wounds, the cuts, the burns... there is no healing... and with that, there is no life.</p>
            <p>And how can there be no life?! There is no life in a cold black soul. And no matter what others may say of the helping and rebuilding and reshaping of the soul, they fail at the most crucial moments... suicide is the only way out.</p>
            <p>There is no other way.</p>
            <p>There is no other way.</p>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <p>There was no other way.</p>
            <br />
            <p>See, this is not a story about death and destruction.</p>
            <p>It is a story of rebuilding.</p>
            <p>It is the story of how I overcame.</p>
