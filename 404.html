    <li>Check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)" class="link"><span title="Legend of Zelda ftw!!!">link</span></a> again and make sure that you meant to request this page and that every character is correctly typed, as most people have a lot of truble speling werds correktly</li>

  <tr><td>
    <li>Try <a href="javascript:history.go(0)">reloading</a> the page, as you may be looking at an older version of the page and the page may have been updated in the time it took you to whine and complain about how this page isn't working</li>
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
    <li>Go <a href="javascript:history.back(1)">back</a> to the previous page, because according to most people, backtracking "always works!" (unless the previous page you had opened was an error page also - in that case, keeping going back a while......)</li>
