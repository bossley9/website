what does one do love to empty the mind?
'nothing my dear but sit still and be kind'

and how does one conquer the fearing of death?
'by living the minute and counting the breath'

what does one write love when nothing will come?
'write all the bad until you feel it's done'

say, what of the heart and the way that it breaks?
'pour all the dust into what you create'

what do you do when the words are unkind?
'take it to heart and then leave it behind'

oh, who is the man I am trying to be?
'that I don't know dear but one day we'll see'

how can you love me with all that I've done?
'go back to sleep now and wait for the sun'

but how can I sleep with the world in my head?
'write a quick poem and go back to bed'
