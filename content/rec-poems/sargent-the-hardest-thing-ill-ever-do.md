The hardest thing I'll ever do
Is let go of you
And look forward instead of back at my past.
I wonder how long this broken heart will last.
I guess everything you ever said was a lie,
So I'm going to move forward, or at least I'm going to try.
How many times can a heart crack before it shatters?
Or does it even matter?
I've sat and cried over you way too much,
Just wishing one more time I could feel your touch.
But you don't care, and neither should I.
So I'm going to move on, or at least I'm going to try.
