She speaks to me fondly of passions and talents,
              guitars and stars,
              then stops short
      and apologises for speaking at all.

      All because somewhere in her life,
      someone she loved broke her heart
       by ignoring her beautiful words
            and telling her to
                  shut up,
                keep it down,
                nobody cares.

             People aren't born sad.
            _We make them that way._
