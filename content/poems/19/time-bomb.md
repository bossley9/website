It's a funny world we live in
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Stores to the left, houses to the right
The separation is driving us insane
Half past six and not a second to spare
Race to the end, who will make it first?
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Where did the time go and
What happened to us?
One year left to spare
You go your way, I'll go mine
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
And then it's gone
The horizon has arrived
Time to cross the street
Pack your bags
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Say goodbye to someone you never met
