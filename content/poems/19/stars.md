Who knows how long I will be waiting by the sea shore, awaiting my rescue.
I stand here, not knowing how far away I stand from another human being.
It's a senseless island, and an untouchable universe.
Although I am not bound by my actions or my thoughts, I am restricted by my
intentions and held fast by my feelings.
Drawing in the sand does not make a rescue ship arrive any sooner.
Thinking dangerously does not lure anyÂ sea captains to my island.
Instead, I just lie back in the sand, staring up at the stars, wondering
how many of them, too,

Feel lonely.
