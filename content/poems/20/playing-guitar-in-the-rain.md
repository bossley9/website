So I'm
Strumming sweet melodies by the window
Suddenly the notes brighter and louder fell
As the sky turns black and the cold winds grow
And the music now deafens both heart and hell
The symphony becomes a shrill and I can hear someone screaming
Maybe it was me, I can't really tell
Then it gradually subsides as the sun shines beaming
The pitched ringing fades to a distant bell
Not here
