To dream is to sin.

Structured weeks built by powerful men who control the universe
With mixed expectations and brutal hours
It's no wonder no one wants to be here.

All we do is live to die and die unsatisfied
So is there any question when tables are turned and anguish turns to voices

Which grew, unbound by time, unparalleled by anything humankind has ever known?

I await the day when the universe realigns and
God starts hearing our voices again.
